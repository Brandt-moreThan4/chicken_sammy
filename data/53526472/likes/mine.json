Could get in the way of functionality, but you can tell the men behind the grease are curating a product consistent with an old fashioned philosophy. As you can see the breast is not tossed in Buffalo rather the Buffalo is drizzled atop the hot crispy breast. Personally, I think this strategy yields a more visceral experience of grading each bite on the Buffalo sauce vs dry sammie spectrum. The chicken itself was superb, as you could tell based on a 17 minute wait time it had been fully breaded and fried upon order. The pickles and fresh lettuce carried the chicken crunch the extra mile. My main complaint with this sammie was the bun. These sammie handles looked great from the outside, but upon bite and grip did not hold up well. Inside was too airy and rather deadened the flavor train of the chicken. Toot toot.
