I was delightfully curious when stumbling upon their website, the marketing was superb and the pictures screamed of flavor I knew I had to try.\n\nI ordered ‚ÄúThe Classic‚Äù: Korean Hot Sauce, pickled Daikon slaw, fresh coriander, and coriander-lime Mayo.\n\nThe sandwich came out and boy was it a looker. Upon the first bite I was pleasantly surprised in the flavor combo of the infused Mayo and Korean Hot sauce. The chicken breast, although a bit dry, was flavorful and had a nice fry. I really enjoyed this sammie and if I lived close by you could count on me frequently visiting biweekly, potentially weekly. With that being said, It‚Äôs a must try if you‚Äôre in the area.","user_id":"11667410","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/1000x1332.jpeg.7abc7f0f6f7b40ee9cb3710a6e9debc0"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/573x573.jpeg.283a99294960476abf2d6345f3317e5d","created_at":1665154235,"favorited_by":["11667410","11828657","14009362","19397175","19901671","22089390","23080028","24187380","24187510","32644422","5994102","6173634"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"166515423578105287","name":"Jaxson Pinard","sender_id":"11667410","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"B9F4BACF-1CA7-440E-8062-EEFFF0A7495E","system":false,"text":null,"user_id":"11667410","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/640x640.jpeg.ded641ea175941a89384678919bacec6","created_at":1665144409,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"166514440985152540","name":"Nic Brooksher","sender_id":"24187510","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"8A5D7513-C835-4C8E-B157-07778E056BC9","system":false,"text":"Major bag alert","user_id":"24187510","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/640x640.jpeg.ded641ea175941a89384678919bacec6","created_at":1665144397,"favorited_by":["11667410","12609853","19397175","24187380","32644422"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"166514439770345303","name":"Nic Brooksher","sender_id":"24187510","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"7FD6C7AB-A825-486B-ABAD-46C043F8207F","system":false,"text":"Google translate:\nChicken sammie talk is about to go global?","user_id":"24187510","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/573x573.jpeg.283a99294960476abf2d6345f3317e5d","created_at":1665144308,"favorited_by":["11828657","19397175","24187380","24187510","32644422","5994102"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"166514430886232026","name":"Jaxson Pinard","sender_id":"11667410","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"9D6412A1-8969-43E0-9A3A-7E577A1B2F83","system":false,"text":"üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®\n\nüîúüêì ü•™ üó£ üåç\n\nüö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®üö®","user_id":"11667410","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/750x1334.jpeg.f565399d068b4b289524d91a65f23301"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/640x640.jpeg.ded641ea175941a89384678919bacec6","created_at":1665068711,"favorited_by":["11828657","12609853","32644422","5994102","5994261","6173634"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"166506871106566302","name":"Nic Brooksher","sender_id":"24187510","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"D69F4FC8-B055-447B-8327-F7AEDF5B481C","system":false,"text":null,"user_id":"24187510","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"reply","user_id":"5994102","reply_id":"166499828146936898","base_reply_id":"166499828146936898"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/640x640.jpeg.ded641ea175941a89384678919bacec6","created_at":1665068700,"favorited_by":["5994102"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"166506870030536898","name":"Nic Brooksher","sender_id":"24187510","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"629ADCB0-6A90-42BB-916B-CD1E88E63F87","system":false,"text":"My bad team.

Chicken patty itself was well coated\nwith crispiness and juicy. But the dry buns\nsoaked up too much of the coleslaw (a bit\ntoo sour) and the hot sauce and eventually\nthe whole sandwich just fell apart.

TX. \n\nThis was a nice experience - didn‚Äôt blow my mind, but I was really happy with it. So for the chicken, I actually liked the change up with the air fry. It was still kinda crispy, but not so greasy. For whatever reason though I‚Äôve never had a Thai sammie with a really satisfying crunch and that remains the same. Also, the chicken tenders/thighs on a sammie just always make it a little tougher to eat than a solid breast. Overall flavor was good, and I liked all of the toppings. + the price includes a side (I got pasta salad) which makes it slightly more reasonable. \n\nOne note though is that it was this locations first day open. I did an online order through google and it was ready like 5 mins after it was supposed to be, but for first day I wasn‚Äôt too upset. Otherwise I think it‚Äôs supposed to be some kind of like healthy or fresh eating chain from Cali or something.

it made me realize it wasn‚Äôt as skimpy as I thought (I think they dug out some of the bread this time or something). Liked the toasty aspect of the bun and overall good flavor although I did have to add some sriracha for flavor and sauciness. Dumplings were surprisingly good since I never order chicken dumplings.

The chicken thigh was very thick and juicy, and we spent our meal trying to figure out how they did that - was it two thighs, three thighs? We don't know. It was topped with slaw that added some nice moisture to it but as is often the case can make the chicken breading slightly soggy but this did not detract from the experience significantly.

The bun was amazing it's very soft buttery delicious everything you'd want a bun to be and the sauce was like a pretty good mayo and they had homemade pickles which I don't really like but I know some of you like and I imagine they were pretty good they they looked pretty good.

The WJ sauce was a great addition but honestly, the fact that it was really good fried chicken was enough for me.

It sounds very caucasian of me to say, but it‚Äôs true. I‚Äôd like to see it with a spicy chili glaze drizzled over it or with copious amounts of spicy mayo ala Popeye‚Äôs.

Overall really great Sammie, top tier for me, a few weak spots... like too many Sammies out here \"hot\" is never that hot, bun integrity not awesome, and the fries were trash. But other than that, really solid all around, all the ratios we're right, chicken to bread to sauce to pickles. The chicken was stupid crisp and the fried onions were bomb, unlike any I've had before, really flavorful and maintained good crunch even sauced up and slammed between bread and chicken.

Avid readers will know this new chickie food truck has captured the interest of several BR reviewers. This is the basic sammie, medium spice. The patty had a near perfect thickness and consistency, better than most sammies. Sadly the highlights mostly stop there. The breading was extremely greasy, think funnel cake straight out the fryer greasy. Did not do right by my stomach (aka the sammie bank). The ‚Äúspice‚Äù is pretty poorly done, it was way too heavy on pepper which overpowered most other flavors here. Would‚Äôve preferred it a little spicier, but knowing what I know now I probably would get no spice to avoid that pepper. Slaw was fine. The signature Sando Sauce was disappointing - it‚Äôs a carbon copy of Popeyes, KFC, etc. Just spicy mayo.

Not bad, but interesting for sure. I guess the spice was included in the crust of the fried chicken (kinda like those fried chicken sticks from the gas station roller grills- that I love) which was kind of panko-esque, but it really wasn‚Äôt spicy. No sauce was kind of bold, but that at least allowed for a less messy experience. The menu said it was served on a challa bun, but if that‚Äôs supposed to have any relation to loaves of Jewish bread, it did not.  Tomatoes were a millimeter thicker than I‚Äôd probably do myself, but the most obviously interesting aspect of the meal is the cucumber slices where you may usually expect pickles.

First of all, I think the actual chicken at this place could go up against any fried chicken I've ever had in my life. It was chicken breast but still really juicy and super crisp. The flavors were just on point. Having been to Hattie B's about 2.5 months ago, I can confidently say the flavors better. Chicken 9.68/10.00. As far as the sandwich itself: first of all, it was huge which was awesome. I feel like alot of chicken Sammies are really small like at the merch but this was not. It also had it's comeback sauce on it which was nice. The bun was good but definitely opened it's cheeks to submit to the will of this enormous piece of chicken. Slaw was fine. They season the outside of the chicken with a hot chicken seasoning but would've liked for it to be applied more evenly. It was hot but I'm not uncomfortable. Overall, I give it an 8.9/10. Honorable mention to the chicken bites which were even juicier, crispier and had more seasoning per bite than the sandwich.

Could get in the way of functionality, but you can tell the men behind the grease are curating a product consistent with an old fashioned philosophy. As you can see the breast is not tossed in Buffalo rather the Buffalo is drizzled atop the hot crispy breast. Personally, I think this strategy yields a more visceral experience of grading each bite on the Buffalo sauce vs dry sammie spectrum. The chicken itself was superb, as you could tell based on a 17 minute wait time it had been fully breaded and fried upon order. The pickles and fresh lettuce carried the chicken crunch the extra mile. My main complaint with this sammie was the bun. These sammie handles looked great from the outside, but upon bite and grip did not hold up well. Inside was too airy and rather deadened the flavor train of the chicken. Toot toot.

Elite level sammy going to be coming back for this one often.","user_id":"12064669","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":null,"created_at":1627151978,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162715197836491010","name":"GroupMe","sender_id":"system","sender_type":"system","source_guid":"6ca8fc60cedc0139918022804bcf3bf5","system":true,"text":"A message was deleted.","user_id":"system","event":{"type":"message.deleted","data":{"message_id":"162715195650495790","deleted_at":1627151978,"deletion_actor":"sender","deleter_id":"12064669"}},"platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/739x1600.jpeg.f2860e0f35ad4bf3b83158d331844f8f","created_at":1627151965,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162715196510430942","name":"Joe Cretini","sender_id":"12064669","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-61a6128b-9fab-46ef-9945-1f09689b7b94","system":false,"text":"Gd it ","user_id":"12064669","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":null,"created_at":1627151956,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162715195650495790","name":"GroupMe","sender_id":"12064669","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-106c9eb2-c1f5-4a2c-a5dd-6af2c7997b7c","system":false,"text":"This message has been deleted","user_id":"12064669","platform":"gm","deleted_at":1627151978,"deletion_actor":"sender","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/421x421.jpeg.56a756d5bbdd43fab8068120f804c3f6"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/338x338.jpeg.2b4bc48d59de4c9a883e79346da0017f","created_at":1626928371,"favorited_by":["11828657","5994261"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162692837129507683","name":"Michael Hubbell","sender_id":"5994102","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"1044E779-8AAD-4161-89CE-EDD0C8F3A4B1","system":false,"text":null,"user_id":"5994102","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/721x960.jpeg.7c865dca47aa4a019d9036bbff08d61b"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/750x750.jpeg.30ae0b20912a4fc182519a3edcb607cd","created_at":1626921612,"favorited_by":["24187510","29485744","33844392","5994261"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162692161235372668","name":"Taylor Stirling","sender_id":"11828657","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"60625A0D-17F9-46CF-BBFC-2B1DB1243B4A","system":false,"text":null,"user_id":"11828657","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/750x750.jpeg.30ae0b20912a4fc182519a3edcb607cd","created_at":1626921470,"favorited_by":["24187510","5994261"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162692147053502720","name":"Taylor Stirling","sender_id":"11828657","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"A2F4E897-A5AA-4435-B532-0533994D6DDE","system":false,"text":"Spilling out everywhere cause you squeezing the life out the other end ","user_id":"11828657","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/1000x1332.jpeg.20c2f8b9d9f54575a021a574523afaab"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/338x338.jpeg.2b4bc48d59de4c9a883e79346da0017f","created_at":1626910921,"favorited_by":["11828657","12064669","12609853","19130219","22089390","33844392","5994261","5994262"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"162691092131694397","name":"Michael Hubbell","sender_id":"5994102","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"A9A5EB8C-AFD4-4D07-AB1F-23E2CDC37439","system":false,"text":"Buffalo chicken wrap today at work.

The chicken, crispy and well cooked. I personally love some bacon on a sammie which just made the flavor even better. While the sammie was top tier, it was actually improved by the aioli sauce used for the truffle fries. Overall, pretty close to being the sammie of my dreams. 9.3/10 without aioli, 9.7/10 with aioli.

I just prefer Buffalo style when we we‚Äôre talking hot Sammies. The pickles were good but I don‚Äôt remember thinking ‚Äúwow amazing homemade pickles!‚Äù Or anything. Pimento was good if you‚Äôre into pimento. Would‚Äôve been so much better with some slaw on it or some creamy cold dipping sauce.

Something I really enjoyed always that the chicken was a very even 1/2 inch thickness throughout the whole sandwich. But what stole the show, was the spicy guajillo sauce added on top. It was thick and perfectly spicy and a little smoky. It also didn't make the chicken soggy at all. I highly recommend this to any chicken sammie enthusiast.

Really liked the rest of the toppings, esp jalape√±o and fried onion but they were filled a little by the mayo.

Garlic mayo moistens the perfectly toasted sesame seed bun to excite this lad's eager taste buds, and it certainly doesn't hurt that the bacon is the best I've had on this side of the Atlantic. While the chicken could have been more exciting in the way it was spiced, I have to hand it to the Brits here - they've figured out how to fry some bird.

This regional offering has been one of my favorites for years. It‚Äôs not much to marvel over, but looks can be deceiving. The bun is toasted on the inside but is otherwise unremarkable. The two toppings are shredded lettuce and mayo. The patty is surprisingly tasty, if you can get over the fact that it‚Äôs processed chicken. It has a spicy dry coating that pairs well with the mayo. I think the taste is good, but price is the player here. For only $1.75 it‚Äôs hard to find a better bargain. I usually get 2 and add a small fry, and have a $4 lunch that keeps me full until supper time. I think it is objectively a 4 or 5/10 but when you want something cheap, quick, and not too messy besides some stray lettuce, this is far and away the best option.

A classic buffalo chicken sammie. Hefty chicken breast with crispy skin. Buffalo sauce was really good, just that classic buffalo flavor a bit on the spicy side (I personally enjoy).

Before ordering I thought they were just corny but after trying, I can say they really add something to the sandwich. Great complementary texture to the chicken and just enough chip to taste but not too much. I was shocked with how much I liked them on there, really elevated the sammie. Overall a strong 8/10.

Thank u and have a nice day.\n\nWarm regards,\nSammie","user_id":"5994262","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/1134x2016.jpeg.1ea3dae48609443881d9e60a82af3fe1"}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/739x1600.jpeg.f2860e0f35ad4bf3b83158d331844f8f","created_at":1583708923,"favorited_by":["12609853","29177098","5994102","6173634"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158370892370445028","name":"Joe Cretini","sender_id":"12064669","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-93466c93-8256-4e54-b2f7-ef1961b75fb2","system":false,"text":null,"user_id":"12064669","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"type":"image","url":"https://i.groupme.com/1512x2016.jpeg.e10a99699ceb4939826f48162f760bef"}],"avatar_url":null,"created_at":1583708898,"favorited_by":["12609853","5994102"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158370889873995028","name":"Sammie Chastain","sender_id":"5994262","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-51f11e70-0952-41e8-bf96-29290fc60d20","system":false,"text":null,"user_id":"5994262","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":null,"created_at":1583707028,"favorited_by":["12609853"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158370702867419096","name":"Sammie Chastain","sender_id":"5994262","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-88d43152-4351-4273-ad3d-196c88e44529","system":false,"text":"Pics won't send but we'll do a review","user_id":"5994262","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":null,"created_at":1583706701,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158370670122878617","name":"Sammie Chastain","sender_id":"5994262","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"android-5a5337d8-d4a6-4feb-b3e6-e19cc08a161b","system":false,"text":"At the wateringhole","user_id":"5994262","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/586x586.jpeg.9849cbcf0e004be8b00bc9b2e260b361","created_at":1583638902,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158363890214245572","name":"Michael Hubbell","sender_id":"5994102","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"8A0331DE-6180-4481-870F-94C01D06383F","system":false,"text":"All I want is chuck fil a rn","user_id":"5994102","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"loci":[[65,11]],"type":"mentions","user_ids":["22089390"]}],"avatar_url":"http://i.groupme.com/638x638.jpeg.b6ac948ce2fa40c6bb145ca22d3f8d3d","created_at":1583623795,"favorited_by":["5994102"],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158362379558652757","name":"Sam Wetzel","sender_id":"20242704","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"EBC5C13E-44A0-4829-987D-ADB2FB8D305C","system":false,"text":"Proud you‚Äôre sharing your lady love with the chicken sammie gang @Joe Stassi ","user_id":"20242704","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/1024x1024.jpeg.f5cfae0cece64f87811ad9c4e4500acc","created_at":1583616635,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158361663506948382","name":"Joe Stassi","sender_id":"22089390","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"F8FC0B98-E3F8-41EF-A4AD-664ED4473C94","system":false,"text":"no i don‚Äôt remember ","user_id":"22089390","platform":"gm","pinned_at":null,"pinned_by":""},{"attachments":[{"loci":[[0,11]],"type":"mentions","user_ids":["22089390"]}],"avatar_url":"https://i.groupme.com/586x586.jpeg.9849cbcf0e004be8b00bc9b2e260b361","created_at":1583616609,"favorited_by":[],"group_id":"53526472","id":"158361660922177148","name":"Michael Hubbell","sender_id":"5994102","sender_type":"user","source_guid":"190B8854-3CA7-4F8C-9D47-4C54F39F3A08","system":false,"text":"@Joe Stassi They didn‚Äôt have the sweet prince in Baton Rouge.
